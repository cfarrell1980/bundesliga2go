**Installation**
================
Once you have cloned the bundesliga2go repository and have it stored locally
on your harddrive you need to ensure that you have certain Python modules
installed. These are requirements of the server.py and of the various
bundesliga and OpenLigaDB APIs included in the package. The requirements are:

- web.py (http://www.webpy.org)
- gevent (http://www.gevent.org)
- gevent-websocket (http://www.gelens.org/code/gevent-websocket/)
- Suds (https://fedorahosted.org/suds)
- Paste (http://www.pythonpaste.org)
- APScheduler (http://packages.python.org/APScheduler/)
- pyOpenSSL (https://launchpad.net/pyopenssl) if you want to use SSL on CherryPy
- PIL (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) for stitching icons
- pymongo (http://api.mongodb.org/python/)

bundesliga2go also requires that mongodb is installed (and running) on your
system. The version should be at least 1.8. When you are sure that all of these
requirements are installed, you are basically ready to go.

**Starting the scheduler**
==========================
The scheduler is responsible for updating the local database with data from
openligadb.de. This is done by using APScheduler to schedule a function to run
every x seconds (you define this in the script itself). This function checks if
there are matches in progress. If not, the function just returns. Otherwise, the
function uses bundesligaSync.py to update the Match locally.
To start the scheduler run:

``python scheduler.py``

You can put the scheduler into the background by running:
``python scheduler.py &``

**Running the server**
======================
To get the server up and running you simply have to run the following command
in the directory in which the server.py script is located:

``python server.py``

You can specify the port number directly on the commandline as well by entering
something like:

``python server.py 8081``

The default port used is port 8080. You will get an error if there is already
something listening/using port 8080. You can either stop the other service or
choose another port for server.py.
