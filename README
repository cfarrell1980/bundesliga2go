**Installation**
================
Once you have cloned the bundesliga2go repository and have it stored locally
on your harddrive you need to ensure that you have certain Python modules
installed. These are requirements of the server.py and of the various
bundesliga and OpenLigaDB APIs included in the package. The requirements are:

- web.py (http://www.webpy.org)
- SQLAlchemy (http://www.sqlalchemy.org)
- Suds (https://fedorahosted.org/suds)
- Paste (http://www.pythonpaste.org)
- APScheduler (http://packages.python.org/APScheduler/)
- pyOpenSSL (https://launchpad.net/pyopenssl) if you want to use SSL on CherryPy
- PIL (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) for stitching icons


When you are sure that all of these requirements are installed, you are
basically ready to go.

**Running the server**
======================
To get the server up and running you simply have to run the following command
in the directory in which the server.py script is located:

``python server.py``

You can specify the port number directly on the commandline as well by entering
something like:

``python server.py 8081``

The default port used is port 8080. You will get an error if there is already
something listening/using port 8080. You can either stop the other service or
choose another port for server.py.

When you first start the server the script will automatically check if a local
database has been configured and if it has been synchronised with openligadb.
If not, this will be done first. This may take some time.
