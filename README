**Installation**
================
Once you have cloned the bundesliga2go repository and have it stored locally
on your harddrive you need to ensure that you have certain Python modules
installed. These are requirements of the Python jsonServer and of the various
bundesliga and OpenLigaDB APIs included in the package. The requirements are:

- web.py (http://www.webpy.org)
- SQLAlchemy (http://www.sqlalchemy.org)
- Suds (https://fedorahosted.org/suds)
- Paste (http://www.pythonpaste.org)

When you are sure that all of these requirements are installed, you are basically
ready to go.

**Running the server**
======================
To get the server up and running you simply have to run the following command in the
directory in which the jsonServer.py script is located:

``python jsonServer.py``

You can specify the port number directly on the commandline as well by entering something
like:

``python jsonServer.py 8081``

The default port used is port 8080. You will get an error if there is already something
listening/using port 8080. You can either stop the other service or choose another port
for the jsonServer.py server.
