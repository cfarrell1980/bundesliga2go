**Installation**
================
Once you have cloned the bundesliga2go repository and have it stored locally
on your harddrive you need to ensure that you have certain Python modules
installed. These are requirements of the Python jsonServer and of the various
bundesliga and OpenLigaDB APIs included in the package. The requirements are:

- web.py (http://www.webpy.org)
- SQLAlchemy (http://www.sqlalchemy.org)
- Suds (https://fedorahosted.org/suds)
- Paste (http://www.pythonpaste.org)
- APScheduler (http://packages.python.org/APScheduler/)
- pyOpenSSL (https://launchpad.net/pyopenssl) only if you want to use SSL on CherryPy
- PIL (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) for stitching icons

If you are running openSUSE, it is recommended that you add the repository
devel:languages:python to your zypper repositories. For example, if you have
openSUSE 11.3, use the following command (as root):

``zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/python/openSUSE_11.3 DLPython``

You can then install your dependencies as follows:

``zypper in python-sqlalchemy python-webpy python-suds python-paste python-apscheduler python-openssl``

When you are sure that all of these requirements are installed, you are basically
ready to go.

**Running the server**
======================
To get the server up and running you simply have to run the following command in the
directory in which the jsonServer.py script is located:

``python jsonServer.py``

You can specify the port number directly on the commandline as well by entering something
like:

``python jsonServer.py 8081``

The default port used is port 8080. You will get an error if there is already something
listening/using port 8080. You can either stop the other service or choose another port
for the jsonServer.py server.

When you first start the server the script will automatically check if a local database
has been configured and if it has been synchronised with openligadb. If not, this will
be done first. This may take some time.

Also, the script will check if there is an existing valid teams.png image (i.e. the 
stitched together individual team icons). If not, the script will download all of the
season team's icons and stitch them together. It will also dynamically generate the
appropriate CSS so that the individual icon can be addressed.
