A scheduler that uses APScheduler (http://packages.python.org/APScheduler/) to
schedule a regular slow poll to check if there is a match in progress.  If there
is a match in progress then a faster poll is started. The faster poll updates the
local database with data from upstream. You can install the python-apscheduler
package from devel:languages:python on openSUSE or with easy_install from PyPi
